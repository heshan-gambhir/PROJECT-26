RECIPE TO DALGONA COFFEE:

INGREDIENTS
2 tbsp. granulated sugar
2 tbsp. instant coffee 
2 tbsp. cold water
Ice, for serving
Milk, for serving

DIRECTIONS
1. In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)
2. Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, mixing before drinking, if desired.
